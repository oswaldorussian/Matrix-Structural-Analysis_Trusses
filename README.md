# Matrix-Structural-Analysys_Trusses
A matrix structural analysis framework developed to solve truss problems (Code in Spanish).

1. Run the AddPath.m script.
2. Use the Editor.m script as input file for your truss problem.
3. Here, define your coordinates ("Coord"), connectivity and (elastic) material properties ("Conectividad"), loads, and boundary conditions ("Restricciones")
4. Run to obtain displacement and support reaction vectors.

If interested, you may want to inspect the Operador.m function for an illustration of how a (simplified) finite-element code works.
